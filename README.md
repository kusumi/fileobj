=======

## About

+ [http://sourceforge.net/projects/fileobj/](http://sourceforge.net/projects/fileobj/)

+ fileobj is a portable hex editor with vi like interface. This software is written in Python and works on Python 2.6 or above. It works on Linux, NetBSD, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, DragonFlyBSD and possibly other unix operating systems that support ncurses. This software provides basic vi commands for binary editing. Features include insert, replace, delete data in hexadecimal or ascii, cut and paste, undo and redo, visual select, partial buffer loading, multiple buffers support, multiple windows support, block device (raw disk) support, mapping binary data to C struct, etc.

+ Repository is available at GitHub [https://github.com/kusumi/fileobj/tree/v0.7](https://github.com/kusumi/fileobj/tree/v0.7)

## Prerequisites

+ Python 2.6 or above

    + Python 3 is supported since [v0.7](https://github.com/kusumi/fileobj/tree/v0.7)

    + Python 2.5 support is dropped in [v0.7](https://github.com/kusumi/fileobj/tree/v0.7), use [v0.6](https://github.com/kusumi/fileobj/tree/v0.6) for Python 2.5

    + [v0.6](https://github.com/kusumi/fileobj/tree/v0.6) and [v0.7](https://github.com/kusumi/fileobj/tree/v0.7) are basically the same at this point except for supported Python versions mentioned above

## Examples

+ Open a file *a.out*

        $ fileobj ./a.out

+ Open a file *a.out* in readonly mode

        $ fileobj ./a.out -R

+ Open a file *a.out* from offset 1234

        $ fileobj ./a.out@1234

+ Open a file *a.out* and read 1000 bytes from offset 1234

        $ fileobj ./a.out@1234:1000

+ Open a file *a.out* and read from offset 1234 to 2234 (equivalent to above)

        $ fileobj ./a.out@1234-2234

+ Open a file *a.out* and read the first 1000 bytes

        $ fileobj ./a.out@:1000

## Note

+ Generates a new directory *${HOME}/.fileobj*

+ Some keyboard keys may not work correctly on vt100 terminal

+ NetBSD requires py-curses package other than the python package itself

        $ uname
        NetBSD
        $ sudo python ./setup.py install --force --record ./install.out
        No module named _curses
        $ cd /usr/pkgsrc/devel/py-curses
        $ sudo make install

+ If the ncurses border lines are shown with messed up characters on Putty, try changing settings of the section *"Window -> Appearance"* and/or *"Window -> Translation"*. Changing the character set from *"UTF-8"* (or whatever the setting already there) to *"Use font encoding"* may work.
